# My Research Interests And Statements
NeuroAI, DL&AI, CompCogSci, CompCogNeuro  

How to Integrate AI and Neuroscience:
* Discuss the challenges in current AI and the corresponding solving pathways (or say fileds).  
Flexibility - self-supervised learning, transfer learning, continual learning, meta learning, one-shot learning, imitation learning.  
* Explore potential solutions from neuroscience and the advancements.  
SNN - neuromorphic hardware  
* Envision the prospects of integrating both fileds.



# Research Review For Myself
## NeuroAI 
### Catalyzing...
* Intro: 
	* Background: CompArch?, DNN-visual processing circuits in the cat neocortex, RL-behavior and neural activity during learning, Attention-[saliency-normalize(or say transform), ...] Decades Old 
	* Challenge: sensorimotor - interact - emobodied, adaptability, flexibility
		> &#10071; The main bottleneck in the development of general robots lies in intelligence rather than hardware. ---<cite>X Square</cite>
	
		* engage environments - modular and hierarchy, partial autonomy, amortized control
		* behave flexibly
		* compute efficiently - credit assignment in recurrence for processing sequential information, hardware-[synaptic dynamics within adjacent dendritic spines, spiking]
